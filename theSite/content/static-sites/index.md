## Introduction

A static site usually has all the pages pre-rendered, when those are being served to the browser.

{{% eyes-up %}}

{{% fragment %}}With backend {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without backend {{% /fragment %}}

## With Backend

Server side rendering. Meaning you can have some backend application that will generate the page.

{{% fragment %}}<br/>For example<br/>{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}}- **NodeJS** EJS, vuexpress, react, etc.{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}}- *Others*: Twig, JSP, ASP, etc.{{% /fragment %}}

## Without backend

Usually pure HTML, CSS and some JS for interactivity,
therefore easy and fast.
